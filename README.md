# landing-page

I am writing this post-completion and pre-submission of the landing page project, in total it took about 4-5 hours of work (obviously with lots of breaks in-between, I'm not sure how I would actually track the time taken). This was done over a 24 hour period.

It was pretty straightforward for the most part, since I started off with the html skeleton first before delving into css. This gave me the opportunity to think about how I would flex each section. I added a bit of flair to some elements of the landing page i.e navigation links, buttons, illustrations to give it a bit more personality.

Overall I think this really helped to solidify my understanding of flex, but of course I would like to delve deeper for attributes such as grow/shrink etc. It also helped to improve my git workflot (notably changing from using past tense to writing my commits as if I was giving an order). I look forward to the rest of the curriculum.
